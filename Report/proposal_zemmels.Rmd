\textbf{Exposition} The Congruent Matching Cells (CMC) algorithms are a family of algorithms used to quantify the similarity between two cartridge cases. The algorithms involve partitioning two cartridge case scans into a grid of "cells" (typically 7x7 or 8x8), performing a comparison between paired cells (e.g., cell [2,2] in one scan is compared to cell [2,2] in another scan), and classifying the cell pairs as "congruent matching" or "non-congruent matching" depending on the results of the comparison. The number of congruent matching cell pairs, the "CMC count," is used as the similarity score. (Note: I've intentionally kept this explanation short because the nature of the algorithms themselves are not the focus of the project).

In order for a scientific method to be considered admissible evidence in court, the [Daubert Standard](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/daubert_standard) requires that its error rate be known.
Recent work on the CMC algorithms has focused on modeling the distribution of known match and known non-match CMC counts for the purpose of obtaining a model-based estimate of the error rate.
Most recently, [Zhang (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2021.110912) proposed modeling a CMC count as the sum of dependent Bernoulli trials using the Bahadur-Lazarsfeld model which estimates the correlation between pairs of cells.
However, this model assumes that the pairwise correlation is the same between all pairs of cells and across all cartridge case comparisons.
In this project, the proposed model will include a different dependency structure.

\textbf{What is your scientific question?}

Can we incorporate repeated measure and spatial dependencies in a model for the CMC counts?

\textbf{What are your data?}

We have CMC results for all pairwise comparisons between 204 cartridge case scans taken by CSAFE.

\textbf{What single model do you propose to fit to answer your scientific question?}

Let $i,j$ index $S$ scans (equiv., cartridge cases), $i,j = 1,...,S$. 
Denote a comparison between scan $i$ and scan $j$ as $i,j$.
Define function $b(\cdot)$ that maps a scan index to the barrel from which it was fired (e.g., $b(i) = A$ if scan $i$ originated from barrel $A$).
Let $\pmb{y}_{i,j} \in \{0,1\}^{N_{i,j}}$ be the vector of CMC results for the comparison $i,j$ where $N_{i,j}$ is the total number of cells in comparison $i,j$.
Identify a particular cell in comparison $i,j$ with its [row,column] index $[k,l]$.
<!-- , $k = 1,...,R_{i,j}$ and $l = 1,...,C_{i,j}$.  -->
Then let $y_{i,j,[k,l]} \in \pmb{y}_{i,j}$ be the CMC result for cell $[k,l]$ of comparison $i,j$.
Assume $y_{i,j,[k,l]} | p_{i,j,[k,l]} \sim$ Bernoulli$(p_{i,j,[k,l]})$ where
$$
\text{logit}(p_{i,j,[k,l]}) = \alpha_0 + \alpha_{b(i)} + \alpha_{b(j)} + \gamma_{b(i)b(j)} + f_u(u_i) + f_u(u_j) + f_s(s_{[k,l]}).
$$

\underline{Random-effect terms:} $\alpha_{b(i)}, \alpha_{b(j)}$ are random-effect parameters representing the effect of barrels $b(i)$ and $b(j)$ (e.g., $\alpha_{b(i)} = \alpha_{b(j)}$ if scans $i$ and $j$ originated from the same barrel) and $\gamma_{b(i)b(j)}$ is their interaction (barrel-level repeated measures).
We assume that the $\alpha_{b(i)} \sim N(0,\tau_b^{-1})$ and $\gamma_{b(i)b(j)} \sim N(0,\tau_g^{-1})$ for $i,j = 1,...,S$.
$f_u(u_i)$ and $f_u(u_j)$ are [u]nustructured random-effect parameters intended to account for the fact that we observe multiple CMC scores from scans $i$ and $j$ (cartridge case-level repeated measures).
Assume that $f_u(u_i)$ and $f_u(u_j)$ are conditionally independent and $f_u(u_i) \sim N(\alpha_{b(i)}, \tau_u^{-1})$ for $i,j = 1,...,S$.
This random-effects part of the model is similar to a model used for glass evidence proposed in [Aitken et al. (2007)](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.335.3316&rep=rep1&type=pdf) (where cartridge case is to glass fragment as barrel is to glass pane).

\underline{Spatial term:} $f_s(s_{[k,l]})$ is a [s]patially structured term intended to account for spatial correlation between neighboring cells (or sites, hence the $s$).
In \texttt{INLA}, we'll probably assume something simple such as  $f_s(\pmb{s})$ following a "Besag" distribution defined by $f_s(s_{[k,l]}) | f_s(\pmb{s}_{-[k,l]}), \tau_s \sim N\left(\frac{1}{n_{[k,l]}} \sum_{[k,l] \sim [m,n]} f_s(s_{[m,n]}), \frac{1}{n_{[k,l]} \tau_s}\right)$
where $n_{[k,l]}$ is the number of neighbors of node $[k,l]$ and $[k,l] \sim [m,n]$ indicates that two nodes $[k,l]$ and $[m,n]$ are neighbors. We will assume a 3x3 neighborhood structure except for cells on the boundaries of the scan.

The hyperparameters requiring assignment are $\tau_b, \tau_g, \tau_u, \tau_s$. I believe the \texttt{INLA} default is to set them to 0.001 which I can use initially and change if necessary.
<!-- Ultimately, we are interested in the CMC count for comparison $i,j$ which can be expressed as $\pmb{1}^T \pmb{y}_{i,j} = \sum_{[k,l]} y_{i,j,[k,l]}$. -->

\textbf{Implementation issue} When a scan is partitioned into cells, many of these cells do not contain observations (due to the circular nature of the cartridge case and the rectangular nature of the scan matrix - see \autoref{fig:neighborExample}). The CMC algorithms simply ignore such cells. However, the cells that are excluded change across comparisons (e.g., cell [2,3] may contain observations in one scan but not another). As such, I don't know if I should define a unique neighborhood structure per comparison or if I can get away with defining, for example, a 3x3 neighborhood structure on an entire 8x8 rectangular graph knowing that some of the observations will be \texttt{NA} for each comparison. I was hoping to get some feedback on this issue, so let me know if it isn't well-posed and I can try to explain it better.
