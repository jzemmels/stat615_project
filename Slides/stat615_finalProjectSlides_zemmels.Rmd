# Introduction

<!-- --- -->

<!-- # Cartridge Cases & Breech Face Impressions -->

<!-- - *Cartridge case* is a bullet casing -->

<!-- - During firing, the cartridge case slams against back wall of the barrel -->

<!--   - "Back wall" is called the *breech face* -->

<!-- -- -->

<!-- - Markings on the breech face "stamp" into the cartridge case -->

<!--   - Markings are called *breech face impressions* -->

<!--   - Considered as the barrel leaving its "fingerprint" on the cartridge case -->

<!-- -- -->

<!-- - Forensic examiners use breech face impressions to determine whether two cartridges match -->

<!--   - "Match" means they were fired from the same barrel -->

# Cartridge Cases & Breech Face Impressions

knitr::include_graphics("images/cartridgeCaseSideBySide_rotated.png")
```

<!-- The figure shows two cartridges cases. -->
<!-- Take note of the striated markings on both cartridge cases. -->
<!-- Examiners would study the markings to determine whether the two cartridge cases match -->
<!-- Until recently, there has not been a method to quantitatively measure the similarity between two cartridge cases. -->

# Congruent Matching Cells (CMC) Algorithm

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/kmOriginalMethod_combined.png",dpi = 250)
```

Partition two cartridge case scans into a grid of cells

--

Each cell is classified as a "Congruent Matching Cell" (CMC) or a "non-CMC"

Measure the pair's similarity as the total number of CMCs, the *CMC count*

--

Truly matching cartridge case pairs should have a large CMC count


<!-- 1 -->

<!-- Attempt 2: 0.8 -->

---

# CMC Method Error Rate

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/cmcDistributionFakeExample_edited.png",dpi = 250)
```

In practice, we don't know whether two cartridge cases truly match.

--

We use a CMC count decision boundary to classify matches or non-matches

- E.g., a CMC count greater than or equal to $6$ implies that a pair is a match

--

For a decision boundary, what proportion of pairs will be misclassified?

**Can we obtain a model-based estimate for the CMC method error rate?**

# Pairwise Comparison CMC Data

$102$ cartridge cases fired from $4$ barrels: $G, F, U,$ and $R$

- $\binom{102}{2} = 5151$ total pairwise comparisons

- $1254$ known match comparisons, $3897$ known non-match comparisons

--

Using an $8 \times 8$ grid of cells, CMC counts were obtained for each pair

- $5151*64 = 329664$ total observations

- Each observation is a $1$ (CMC), $0$ (non-CMC), or `NA` (not considered)

```{r,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
tibble::tibble(`Cell Index` = c("1, 1","1, 2","1, 3","1, 4","..."),
           `CMC Classif.` = c("NA","1","0","1","...")) %>%

<!-- # Random-Effects Markov Random Field Model -->

<!-- Model observation associated with a single cell as Bernoulli -->

<!-- - Use GLM structure for the "success" probability -->

<!-- - Incorporate barrel-level and scan-level repeated measure effect -->

<!-- - Incorporate neighboring scan spatial effect as Markov Random Field -->

---

Index scans $i,j = 1,...,102$. 
<!-- Define set of barrels $\pmb{B} = \{G,F,U,R\}$. -->

- Denote $i,j$ as comparison between scan $i$ and scan $j$

<!-- - Define $b(\cdot)$ as function mapping a scan to its barrel of origin -->

- Use row and column indexing for each cell: $[r,c]$, $r,c = 1,...,8$

- E.g., $y_{i,j,[r,c]}$ is $[r,c]$th observation from comparison $i,j$

--

Assume $y_{i,j,[r,c]} | p_{i,j,[r,c]} \overset{ind}{\sim} Bern(p_{i,j,[r,c]})$ where

\begin{align*}
\text{logit}(p_{i,j,[r,c]}) =  &\underbrace{\sum_{A \in \{G,F,U,R\}} \beta_A \cdot I\left(\text{scan } i \text{ or scan } j \text { originated from barrel } A\right)}_{\text{Barrel-level Random Effect}} \\
& + \underbrace{\sum_{...} \gamma_{AC} \cdot I\left(\text{barrel } A \text{ scan is compared to barrel } C \text{ scan}\right)}_{\text{Barrel-level Interaction}} \\
& + \underbrace{\kappa_i + \kappa_j}_{\text{Scan-level R.E.}} + \underbrace{\lambda_{[r,c]}}_{\text{MRF Term}}
\end{align*}

where $``..."$ is $A,C \in \{G,F,U,R\}: A \neq C$

<!-- 1.3 -->

<!-- Attempt 2: 1.16 -->

---

Assume independence and for $i = 1,...,S$ and $A, C \in \{G,F,U,R\}$:
\begin{align*}
\beta_{A} &\overset{ind}{\sim} N(0,\tau_{A}^{-1}) \\
\tau_{A} &\overset{ind}{\sim} Gam(1,0.00005) \\
\gamma_{AC} &\overset{ind}{\sim} N(0,\tau_{AC}^{-1}) \\
\tau_{AC} &\overset{ind}{\sim} Gam(1,0.00005) \\
\kappa_i &\overset{ind}{\sim} N(0,\tau_{k}^{-1}) \\
\tau_{k} &\sim Gam(1,0.00005).
\end{align*}

--

For $\pmb{\lambda}_{-[r,c]} \equiv \{\lambda_{m,n} : m \neq r, n \neq c\}$ and $\mathcal{N}_{[r,c]}$ is an 8-neighborhood:

\begin{align*}
\lambda_{[r,c]} | \pmb{\lambda}_{-[r,c]}, \tau_l &\overset{ind}{\sim} N\left(\frac{1}{|\mathcal{N}_{[r,c]}|} \sum_{\lambda_{m,n} \in \mathcal{N}_{[r,c]}} \lambda_{[m,n]}, \frac{\tau_l^{-1}}{|\mathcal{N}_{[r,c]}|}\right) \\
\tau_l &\sim Gam(1,0.00005).

# Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation

Uses deterministic approximations of univariate posterior marginals.

For parameter vector $\phi$ and hyperparameter vector $\theta$:

\begin{align*}
\pi(\theta_j | y) &= \int p(\theta)\ d\theta_{-j} \\
\pi(\phi_i | y) &= \int p(\phi_i | \theta, y) p(\theta | y)\ d\theta.
\end{align*}

Use numeric integration to estimate these integrals.

For a particular value $\theta^k$, integrands are proportional to:

\begin{align*}
p(\theta | y) \propto \frac{p(y | \phi, \theta) p(\phi, \theta) p(\theta)}{p(\phi | \theta, y)} \\
p(\phi_i | \theta^k,y) \propto \frac{p(y | \phi, \theta^k) p(\phi,\theta^k) p(\theta^k)}{p(\theta_{-i} | \phi_i, \theta^k, y)}.
\end{align*}

Use a Laplace approximation to estimate these denominators.

### Scientific Question Simulation Procedure

We have modeled observations associated with a single cell: $y_{i,j,[r,c]}$.

We are primarily interested in the CMC counts:

$$C_{i,j} = \sum_{r,c} y_{i,j,[r,c]}.$$

--

We'll use simulation. Repeat for $t = 1,...,T$:

- Sample $p_{i,j,[r,c]}^{(t)}$ for each $i,j = 1,...,102$ and $r,c = 1,...,8$

- Sample $y_{i,j,[r,c]}^{(t)} | p_{i,j,[r,c]}^{(t)} \overset{ind}{\sim} Bern(p_{i,j,[r,c]}^{(t)})$ for each $i,j,r,c$.

- Compute $C_{i,j}^{(t)} = \sum_{r,c} y_{i,j,[r,c]}^{(t)}$ for each $i,j$.

--

Using a decision boundary of $6$ CMCs, estimated error is:

$$\widehat{\text{Error}} = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} \left(\frac{1}{5151} \sum_{i,j\text{ match}} I\left(C_{i,j}^{(t)} < 6\right) + \sum_{i,j\text{ do not match}}I\left(C_{i,j}^{(t)} \geq 6\right)\right).$$

# Conclusion & Future Work

# Conclusion & Future Work

Error rate seems to be underestimated by model

- In particular, false negative rate is underestimated

Parameter estimates are interpretable

- CMC counts for match comparisons differ across barrels

- Certain scans have lower CMC counts, on average

- Cells on edge of scans are classified as CMCs more often

--

Future Work:

- Explore other models/fitting procedures (STAN, etc.)

  - Overdispersion correction
  
  - Barrel-level mixture model

- Score-based likelihood ratio estimation for Common Source problem
